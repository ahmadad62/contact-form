## Contact Form

**Instructions**:

This is an HTML form with two fieldsets. The first fieldset is for collecting personal data, including first and last name, address, phone, email, and a comment. The second fieldset is for selecting products, including web design options (individual or template) and web development options (HTML&CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB), as well as project start and end dates and the user's preferred operating system (Windows or Linux).

The form is set to submit to a URL on the Formspree service, which will handle the form submission and send an email notification to the specified email address with the form data.
